### Project Description

**Abstract**

Research on oxide materials has gained importance in recent years. While most of the oxide materials exhibit n-type semiconductor behavior, Copper (II) oxide (Cu2O) exhibits p-type oxide semiconductor behavior. Due to the rare p-type behavior, it is possible to produce single junctions with Cu2O or multiple p-n junctions with n-type layers such as ZnO, Ga2O3. Within the scope of the project, the electronic properties of undoped and doped Cu2O crystals will be calculated by density functional theory (DFT) for the first 6 months. It is planned to investigate the electronic properties of Cu2O crystals with different doping and to experimentally examine the doping that improves the p-type property from these dopings. In the literature, it has been observed that the addition of Magnesium (Mg) increases the conductivity of the Cu2O crystal. 

### Objectives

For this reason, it is planned to investigate computationally and experimentally Mg and similarly existing Zinc (Zn), Gallium (Ga) doping atoms. Calculations will be performed with GPAW DFT software running on Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) and gpaw-tools as user interface written in Python language developed by our research group. The growths, which will start within the first 6 months, will be made with the mist vapor deposition method (eng. Mist-CVD), which is our own production. Mist-CVD is a liquid precursor based CVD method using metal salts, acetic acid and alcohols, which does not require vacuum, is economical, non-toxic and low cost used in the growth of many oxide materials. In the first 12 months, Cu2O crystals will be grown on soda-lime, ITO and FTO coated glass, SiO2/Si,c-Al2O3. In the last 6 months, p-n junctions will be created by using the n-type Ga2O3 grown with spin coating. It is planned to examine the effects of many experimental parameters on the growth behavior and physical properties of Cu2O crystals in growth. With this method, besides producing p-n junctions in a cheaper and more environmentally friendly way, it will pave the way for the establishment of a possible start-up company and obtaining a patent for mist-CVD device production.
